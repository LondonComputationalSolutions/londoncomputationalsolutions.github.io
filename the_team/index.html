												<h3><a href="https://uk.linkedin.com/in/mark-taylor-6a63397" target="_blank">Mark Taylor (Managing Director)</a></h3>
											</header>
        <p>Mark undertook his doctorate
	   in 3D boundary layer laminar-turbulent transition prediction techniques for supersonic transport swept wings (what should have been Concorde's replacement) in  Cambridge and then joined
Rolls-Royce Aerospace  (RR)
to design jet engine compressors. He followed this with a spell in the RR Aerothermal Methods team developing and applying aerodynamics and structural design techniques in all areas of jet engine technology.
Mark has also worked on
	   turbo-chargers, combustion, oil tankers, HVAC and acoustics and for 12 years Formula 1 Racing cars at McLaren Racing (winning 44 races out of a total of 207). He has a track-record
	   and passion for developing new fluid dynamics numerical techniques and rapidly
	   deploying them in the real world environment to improve product performance. After a short stint as Chief CAE Engineer at Gordon Murray Design, Mark is now a Deputy Director at the Dept for Business, Energy and Industrial Design (BEIS) responsible for  Programme Delivery of Science and Innovation for Climate and Energy.
He is a Visiting Professor at the Dept of Aeronautics at Imperial College and a Fellow at the Institute of Mathematics and its Applications. </p>

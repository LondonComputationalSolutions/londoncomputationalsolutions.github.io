												<h3><a href="https://uk.linkedin.com/in/mark-taylor-6a63397" target="_blank">Mark Taylor (Director)</a></h3>
											</header>
        <p>Mark undertook his doctorate
	   in 3D boundary layer laminar-turbulent transition prediction techniques for supersonic transport swept wings (what should have been Concorde's replacement) in  Cambridge and then joined
Rolls-Royce Aerospace  (RR)
to design jet engine compressors. He followed this with a spell in the RR Aerothermal Methods team developing and applying aerodynamics and structural design techniques in all areas of jet engine technology.
Mark has also worked on
	   turbo-chargers, combustion, oil tankers, HVAC and acoustics and for 12 years Formula 1 Racing cars at McLaren Racing (winning 44 races out of a total of 207). He has a track-record
	   and passion for developing new fluid dynamics numerical techniques and rapidly
	   deploying them in the real world environment to improve product performance.
Mark is also a FAST runner (the reason he thinks we made him CEO), with a 10.8s 100m to his name but he tends to be a little cagey when asked if he can still do it in this time.</p>

											<h3><a href="https://uk.linkedin.com/in/spencer-sherwin-7235281a" target="_blank">Spencer Sherwin (Director)</a></h3>
											</header>
<p>			Spencer Sherwin is Professor
	   of Computational Fluid Mechanics in the Aeronautics Department at Imperial College
	   London. He is a world leading expert in the development and application of high order
	   methods applied to aeronautical, automotive and biomedical flows completing his doctorate in Princeton.
	He leads a team of researchers focusing on the development and application of parallel spectral/hp element techniques for solving partial differential equations, applying these techniques using direct numerical simulation and stability analysis to a range of applications including biomedical flows and separated/bluff body flows of relevance to offshore engineering and vehicle aerodynamics. Spencer definitely has the FAST thing nailed, his Chair is sponsored by a Formula 1 team.

												<h3><a href="https://uk.linkedin.com/in/davidaham" target="_blank">David Ham (Director)</a></h3>
											</header>
<p> David's research interests centre
           on the development and composition of high level abstractions for scientific
	   computation, particularly geophysical fluids. His interests span computational and
	   computer science and include both new numerical schemes and novel approaches to their
	   implementation.
 David's most recent work is on the automatic generation of finite
	   element models  for the portable solution of partial differential equations.
  David was awarded the 
           <a href="https://www.nag.co.uk/content/wilkinson-prize-numerical-software-2015-0">2015 Wilkinson Prize</a>
	   for Numerical Software.
	He is also our resident polymath with a first degree in both Mathematics and Law as well as fluency in 3 languages and a strong affection for the Opera.

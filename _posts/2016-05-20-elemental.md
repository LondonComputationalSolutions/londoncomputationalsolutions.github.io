Elemental cars are about to launch production of their stunning new RP1 track car weighing in at just 540 kilogrammes with 320 bhp on tap offering mind-blowing acceleration and performance. Cornering grip comes courtesy of aerodynamic downforce generated by a front splitter, front diffuser and rear diffuser. London Computational Solutions have just delivered a performance enhancement package improving the aerodynamic balance and taking the downforce levels over 400 kg at 150 mph.

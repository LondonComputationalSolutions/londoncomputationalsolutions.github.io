Translating Anthroposophical Writings
I am a trained Steiner teacher, having taught at a German Steiner School for ten years. Since I moved to the UK I have been translating for the wider anthroposophical community, among others,  the 'Stuttgarter Hochschule'.
</p>
<p>
Initially, I studied English Studies with a strong focus on religious and spiritual works, devoting my master's thesis to the English medieval women mystics and my PhD to the study and edition of late medieval women saints. My fascination with historical linguistics and language change brought me to teach the History of the English Language at the universities of Bochum and Dortmund and, later, English as a foreign language to the pupils at the Steiner school in Dortmund where I worked.

</p>
<p>
                                                                        My prediliction for religious and spiritual texts makes it ideal for me to translate works from the wider field of anthroposophical and spiritual authors. My training, experience and interest in Steiner education has led me to translate a wide variety of anthroposophical texts, ranging from mainly educational texts to music educational works and philosophical writings.

</p>
<p>
In the recent past, I have been able to explore and apply another of my passions professionally, i.e. music and music as therapy. For the past two years I have been playing therapeutic music to pupils with special educational needs which again opened up new, diverse and fascinating fields of experiences and ideas.

</p>

<p>
Over the course of the past two years, I have been working with pupils with additional needs, playing music with them, for them and to them. However, therapeutic music is used in various other contexts as well. Hospices, hospitals, elderly people's homes, care homes, mainstream schools and religious institutions have all reported about the benefits that therapeutic music and music interaction has on their charges.
The effects of gently played music, in my case the harp, classical guitar, wooden flutes or the voice, can be described as a sound bath or gentle shower. Sound washes through and over the body, lowering blood pressure and heart beat and takes away muscular pains and tension. Song and rhythm can also increase oxygenation in the blood and stimulate the senses increasing attentiveness and communication which will be conducive in helping to orientate in the present. Generally, the recipient enters into a state of deep relaxation or flow, depending upon stimulation and atmosphere.
</p>
<p>
Apart from the more therapeutic approach to music, I also offer basic music lessons to people of all ages and abilities. I have experience teaching basic piano to medium to severe needs children and young adults. I have also taught the recorder and guitar and the Celtic harp. However with each individual it is always worth trying various instruments out first before settling on one in particular. In the case of special needs, if necessary, I try and make modifications to the various requirements that come with the individual instrument.
</p>
<p>
I have taught voice lessons to teenagers and adults, sometimes to people who feel the need to gain confidence with their voice; sometimes to aspiring pop or choir singers; and sometimes to people who simply enjoy learning and improving their own singing voice. I enjoy all of these teaching and singing contexts. It is always a very special situation to begin this journey of discovery of the voice with a person.
</p>
<p>
Steiner education
</p>
<p>
My teaching experience is firmly grounded in the teachings of Rudolf Steiner and Waldorf education. I believe that children (and adults to a certain degree) learn best when they are emotionally comfortable, when their natural interest and curiosity is awakened and tapped into, and when they are in a trusting relationship with their teacher or tutor.
</p>
<p>
I was lucky enough to have Prof Dr Peter Lutzker as my mentor while studying Steiner education. I profited even further when I helped edit his PhD “Teaching as an Art”.
</p>
<p>
My own teaching at Steiner school was always based on an artistic element. That could be a song that we would start the lesson with, or a poem we would recite. It could be a scene from a play or even an action rhyme that we would move to. Spoken word, song, drama (play) and movement have always been key essentials in Steiner education. People learn best, when they are in flow. We can not easily create flow through rationalising, analysing, dissecting a poem when we first read it. But we can create an emotional connection to it and thus a desire to 'move' with that emotion towards the poem. This act of moving could be with our voices, with our bodies or even with our hands (sculpture, drawing etc). Yet it would always allow for us to internalise the piece we are working on, to make it a part of ourselves. What has become a part of yourself, you will not lose again and it will become precious to you.
</p>
<p>
Learner types
</p>
<p>
When teaching any subject, it is essential for the teacher to quickly figure out what kind of a learner type the student might be. Does she like to stay with a single task for a long time? Or is her enthusiasm kindled by new challenges which have to change rather quickly in order for her to keep engaged? Does he need to have something physical/material he can 'grab' in order to understand a topic? Or would he rather wander through imaginary worlds and focus on their details?
To know what it takes for a person to stay engaged is at least two thirds of the way to learning and memorising.
